# Open Source Content for Google Data Studio

This repository contains open source content for [Google Data
Studio](https://datastudio.google.com).

## Community Connectors

[Community
Connectors](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/overview) are
developed using [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and
let users fetch data from external sources into their Data Studio dashboards.

The majority of open sourced Community Connectors have been deployed so that you
can try them out in Data Studio. The deployments are managed by the Data Studio
Developer Relations team and use the latest code for each Community Connector.
